# Registration-System
Designed in C++  in order to registrate camping hardware.
Using a simple form of disk registration, the binary file has stores every object created by the user. This way, you can always acess these objects again.

In order to make ir faster, when the program starts, the hole file is exported to an array, if the file name informed by the user exist. If it does not exist, the program creates a new file and enable the user to add into it.
